## Hello. 

<img src="../images/face.jpg" class="round pull-right" />Iâ€™m currently a senior Political Science and French major at Lewis &amp; Clark College. I just finished a semester abroad in Senegal learning French, Wolof, and about life in Sub-Saharan Africa. I was also in Paris for the summer doing marketing at Tagattitude and trying not to think too much about the fact that college is almost over.

When I graduate I am interested in working in tech marketing, or product development.  Entrepreneurship is a passion of mine and I plan on applying these skills to my future work environment.  Most importantly, I hope to continue learning and improving my skills wherever I end up working.

Besides that, I spend my time traveling, drinking too much coffee, dreaming, golfing, skiing, meeting people, playing frisbee, listening to music, eating good food, and trying new things.

My time abroad came to an abrupt halt about a week ago.  But not before I snuck one last excellent long weekend trip in, this time to Rome.

It's not very often that Italy wins at things, but in this case, the capitol kicks the world's ass at the highest number of super famous monuments per square foot.  Literally saw like 5 things out of my high school textbooks just in the 20 minute walk from the train station.

Anyways, without further ado, pictures.

One of the best parts of living in Europe is how friggen close you are to some of the coolest cities in the world.  Last weekend I went to Amsterdam to visit a friend and spend a few days riding bicycles, listening to music, and drinking coffee.  Casual.

The first thing you notice when you get out of the train station is the ridiculous amount of bikes.  It's the most convenient way to get around town, and everybody does it.  I rented a bike for a few days, and apart from almost crashing a couple times, it was fantastic.  Amsterdam is one of the prettiest cities I've ever been to and riding down cobblestone streets next to the canals and accross bridges feels like you're in a movie.

Another cool thing about all these European cities is that fact that when you visit a museum, it's common to see at least a few paintings you recognize from school text books.  Opting to avoid the 2 hour wait to get into Ann Frank's house, I visited the Rijksmuseum.  [...]

Elephant in the room.  Coffeeshops.  Yes, I went to one.  Duh.  But honestly, weed in Amsterdam is more for the older generation and tourists.  A few years ago they experimented with not allowing foreigners to buy week in the Netherlands.  You actually still cannot buy weed as a foreigner outside of Amsterdam.  However, Amsterdam was spared from this injustice after they realized the catastrphic effect it would have on tourism.

Anyways, my weekend in Amsterdam was awesome and I want to go back.  Maybe even live there.  But actually.

Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS.  Over the past year one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, and now I can build some basic web apps.

From HTML and CSS to different libraries and frameworks.

I've never taken a formal programming class, so my technique and regard for any sort of standard is definitely a little off.

In my experience over the past year, the most difficult part has been dealing with the backend.  Something just doesn't quite click for me and I much prefer spending time on the front end thinking about look, feel, and UX.  So you can probably imaging, when I found Meteor a couple months ago I was stoked.  No more hours digging through Stack Exchange and blog tutorials figuring out which DB to use, how to create secure login, connect oauth, bla bla bla



Being abroad for long, and one year left of college, I've started reaching out to various connections and people whose work I admire and find interesting.  I guess you adults call this networking.  

I kept the list of people to contact in a note on my iPhone, but as the list gets longer, it's more difficult to keep track of where everybody lives, what their emails are, etc.  I wanted a way to make sure that when I visit a place and have some free time, I know who in my network lives there that I can connect with for coffee or food.

Yes, there are lots of things that already do this.  But whatever.  This was more of a learning thing for me, and a way to play around in Meteor.

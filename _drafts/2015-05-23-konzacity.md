Part of my job is researching things having to do with mobile money in Africa.  I'll explain mobile money and why it's important in another post, but future TL;DR, it's important, you should care about it, and its potential is particularly huge in many African and Asian countries.

Anyways, the other day I stumbled upon some articles about Konza Tech City in Kenya.  Granted, the project started a few years ago, but I had never heard of it, I thought it was pretty cool, and I'm sharing it with you now.

Nairobi is one of the leading tech cities in Africa and is full of incubators, geeky people, and cool startups.  The Kenyan government decided to build the Konza Technology City nearby to capitalize on business outsourcing and IT things (more or less taken from the [Konza City](http://www.konzacity.go.ke) website).  Basically they're building a brand new city from the ground up that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and become the "Silicon Savannah" of Africa.  Oh and it's also going to be sustainable,  livable, etc etc.  Mostly all good stuff (some criticism [here](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah)).

Big picture, Konza City speaks to the immense amount of innovation happening in Africa.  The most transformative new technology is born out of necessity.  A new way to turn on a lightbulb isn't quite what you'd call necessity.  Providing financial services to billions of people using "dumb" phones they already own, is.  And it's innovations like this that are happening in Africa today.  [This Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en) sums it up pretty well.  Real innovation is happening in Africa because Africa is solving real problems.

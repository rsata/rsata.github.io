				<title>Konza Tech City, Kenya</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my job is researching things having to do with mobile money in Africa.  I’ll explain mobile money and why it’s important in another post, but future TL;DR, it’s important, you should care about it, and its potential is particularly huge in many African and Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the other day I stumbled upon some articles about Konza Tech City in Kenya.  Granted, the project started a few years ago, but I had never heard of it, I thought it was pretty cool, and I’m sharing it with you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nairobi is one of the leading tech cities in Africa and is full of incubators, geeky people, and cool startups.  The Kenyan government decided to build the Konza Technology City nearby to capitalize on business outsourcing and IT things (more or less taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.konzacity.go.ke&quot;&gt;Konza City&lt;/a&gt; website).  Basically they’re building a brand new city from the ground up that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and become the “Silicon Savannah” of Africa.  Oh and it’s also going to be sustainable,  livable, etc etc.  Mostly all good stuff (some criticism &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big picture, Konza City speaks to the immense amount of innovation happening in Africa.  The most transformative new technology is born out of necessity.  A new way to turn on a lightbulb isn’t quite what you’d call necessity.  Providing financial services to billions of people using “dumb” phones they already own, is.  And it’s innovations like this that are happening in Africa today.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en&quot;&gt;This Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt; sums it up pretty well.  Real innovation is happening in Africa because Africa is solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Amsterdam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of living in Europe is how friggen close you are to some of the coolest cities in the world.  Last weekend I went to Amsterdam to visit a friend and spend a few days riding bicycles, listening to music, and drinking coffee.  Casual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice when you get out of the train station is the ridiculous amount of bikes.  It’s the most convenient way to get around town, and everybody does it.  I rented a bike for a few days, and apart from almost crashing a couple times, it was fantastic.  Amsterdam is one of the prettiest cities I’ve ever been to and riding down cobblestone streets next to the canals and accross bridges feels like you’re in a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing about all these European cities is that fact that when you visit a museum, it’s common to see at least a few paintings you recognize from school text books.  Opting to avoid the 2 hour wait to get into Ann Frank’s house, I visited the Rijksmuseum.  […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elephant in the room.  Coffeeshops.  Yes, I went to one.  Duh.  But honestly, weed in Amsterdam is more for the older generation and tourists.  A few years ago they experimented with not allowing foreigners to buy week in the Netherlands.  You actually still cannot buy weed as a foreigner outside of Amsterdam.  However, Amsterdam was spared from this injustice after they realized the catastrphic effect it would have on tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my weekend in Amsterdam was awesome and I want to go back.  Maybe even live there.  But actually.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What I'm doing here (in Paris for the summer)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I started my job here about 3 weeks ago now at a small fintech company called Tagattitude.  It’s great, and what the company does is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 2 billion people in the world without access to financial services.  This means they can’t save for the future, take out a loan, send money, … - all the services many of us take for granted.  Of these 2 billion, over a billion have phones.  In some of the poorest parts of the world, mobile penetration has surpassed 90% of the population, giving these populations the only tools they need to access financial services that are just as advanced as those found in the western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where mobile money comes in.  It is extremely expensive for banks to build new branches in remote areas, especially given limited infrastructure and resources.  However, by turning mobile phones into payment devices, where your phone number becomes your account number, banks are starting to reach areas left underserved by the traditional banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company I work for provides the platform for mobile financial service (MFS) providers.  If you just can’t help yourself and want to learn more about what this entails, checkout the website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tagpay.fr&quot;&gt;tagpay.fr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this all matters because financial inclusion is paramount to the development of these areas.  Helping mobile money providers reach more people for fractions of the cost is a step towards bringing these parts of the world out of poverty.  With more money in banks, resource mobilization helps develops the area.  With quick and easy transfers, more people have access to loans, and microcredit.  They can develop a credit history, and have a safe place to save money for the future.  Mobile money also reduces the volume of cash in the system, helping workers get paid on time, improving security, and saving the billions spent today dealing with the logistics of transporting, distributing and securing cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the little experience I have, I’ve learned that for me, one of the most important things when choosing a company is to find one that is doing something worth caring about.  That is definitely the case here at Tagattitude and I’m glad to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2 Weeks Back in the Western World</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My semester in Dakar ended about two weeks ago, and now I’m in Paris until the end of July.  Being back has given me some time to think about my time in Senegal and the most important things I’ll take away from my three and a half months there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two very important aspects about Senegal I’ll miss, and I think we can all learn from here in the western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the strength of the community. From interactions with taxi drivers, to merchants, to waiters, to students, there’s a sense that everybody will take care of each other.  Senegal is one of the least touched countries by famines in the area because of people’s willingness to help other in times of need.  Families are large and everybody helps if a member needs help.  And families aren’t just blood related.  Close family friends and members of the community are also considered a part of the family.  So much so that I had friends who had aunts and uncles with whom they weren’t sure how they were related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking down the street, you talk to people and say hi to all the familiar faces you cross.  When someone tried to rob a student on our trip, the entire neighborhood was asking her if she was ok for weeks.  Even the people she had never talked to.  People look out for each other and there’s a sort of connection you feel towards others in your community and neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is how well the Senegalese separate money from happiness.  In a country where the majority lives with about $2 a day, I met so many more kind, relaxed, and genuinely happy people than anywhere else in the world.  And it’s not just a happiness you feel when talking to people, its something you feel walking down the street.  It’s a general feeling in the air where people are content with what they have, and happy to be alive.  Things move slowly and once you adjust to the general noise and chaos of the city, the vibe is actually very relaxed.  People don’t worry about money and wealth, and I think as a result, are happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this second aspect about separating happiness from wealth stems from the first.  People’s happiness doesn’t come from the things they own, or even the things they do.  Instead it comes from those around them - from their community, their friends and their family.  And so after a couple weeks back in a country where people keep to themselves and walk down the streets with two headphones in staring at their feet, these are the two things I’ll miss most about Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to import my senegal blog over to this one.  If you’re interested, the whole things over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://reidsata.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;rsata.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>All Roads Lead to Rome</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My time abroad came to an abrupt halt a couple weeks ago.  But not before I snuck one last excellent long weekend trip in, this time to Rome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not very often that Italy wins at things, but in this case, the capitol kicks the world’s ass at the highest number of super famous monuments per square foot.  Literally saw like 5 things out of my high school textbooks just in the 20 minute walk from the train station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, without further ado, here are some pictures: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/photos/UFj2vLfWk2zPwQU19&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/photos/UFj2vLfWk2zPwQU19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Long Weekend in the Middle of Nowhere</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend it was Bastille day in France. More or less the equivalent to 4th of July for us, but with more wine and less beer. Bastille Day represents the symbolic beginning of the French Revolution, when an angry mob raided the fortress in 1789 for gunpowder, weapons, and ammunition. In the next 15 years, France got a number of things, including but not limited to their national anthem - “la Marseillaise” - the guillotine, a constitution, and the Reign of Terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for this marvelous holiday I did what most Parisians do in the summer, and got the hell out of Paris. My friend’s family has a country house about an hour and a half away, so we spent a long weekend there lounging next to the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France, the minimum number of paid vacations your work can give you is at a quite comfortable five. In addition, if you work more than 35 hours a week (say, I don’t know, a 40 hour week?), you get an optional extra two weeks. Of course, there are workaholics in every country who would rather be at work than at the beach. However, of those two weeks, five (I think…) are not optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of those four days, I needed to get back and work on projects or SOMETHING. But my friends didn’t. And I think that’s a very important difference between a lot of the people I’ve met here, and many stressed out workaholics in the US. Here, people separate work and life. I’ve heard many say that in the US, people live to work, while in France, they work to live. And it’s totally 100% accurate. While we do give the French a lot of shit for their wimpy 35 hour work week, month long vacations, high taxes, and unfavorable business climate, I think there’s something to be said about a high quality of life and general happiness (even though those things mentioned above are still issues). Here, people get what really matters, and what makes them happy. There’s no impossible quest to satisfy a bottomless bucket of ambition, nor any question about where work ends and where life begins. Those people all moved to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With school work and other projects and things (like finding a job…… ugh.), it’s easy to fall into the trap of never being able to take a breath. There’s always something to do, and it’s always urgent. But being here has made me realize it’s really not urgent. So stop, smell the roses, and enjoy your fucking life.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Japanese Chefs in Paris</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I had the chance to eat at a little restaurant in Paris call Le Sot L’y Laisse.  We later learned on the way home that Le Sot L’y Laisse is a small piece of dark meat located on the back, and considered the best part of the chicken.  Cool.  Anyways, the restaurant serves French food, and is run by a Japanese chef.  I had fois gras and fish.  Each was perfectly prepared, and aranged on the plate like a piece of art.  Oh and also the absolute best tasting food I have ever eaten.  Both dishes were French, but as you might expect, had a lot of Japanese influence.  This was the second time I’ve gone to a French restaurant here run by a Japanese chef.  I thought it was pretty interesting because it’s not often you see Japanese chefs cooking non-japanese food in Paris.  Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week after that, I got to go to this fancy shmancy place called OKA.  It’s a little place that fits about 20 people jam-packed.  The cool thing here is that you have no idea what the chef is cooking that day.  When you enter, the only clue you get is the list of ingredients (for alergies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, one week after eating at the best place I’ve ever eaten at ever, I ate at another place that is now the best place I’ve ever eaten at ever.  We had 6 courses that included included everything from ice cream in the entree, to perfectly prepared fish, to beef that melts in your mouth, to things I don’t even know how to describe. The point is it was all delicious, and tastier than anything you could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this place as well, the chef was French, but the dishes definitely had some japanese influence in the ingredients and presentation.  I looked into it a little further and it turns out Japanese chefs have had a pretty strong presence in the French cooking scene for the last decade or so, serving as apprentices at many of the popular, hip, modern restaurants around Paris.  Now, they’re opening their own places, taking traditional French dishes and adding their own flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few articles and pictures:

				<title>Playing Around in Meteor.js</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS.  Over the past year, one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, a few libraries and frameworks, and now I can build basic web apps.  I’ve never taken a formal programming class, so I’m sure my code is full of things that would make any experienced developer cringe.  But it works, and so they tell me, that’s all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the most difficult part for me has been learning backend development.  Something just doesn’t quite click for me and I much prefer spending time on the frontend thinking about look, feel, and UX.  So I was pretty stoked when I found Meteor a couple months ago.  No more hours digging through StackOverflow and blog tutorials figuring out how to set up a database, create secure logins, connect oauth, bla bla bla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyways, the past couple weekends I’ve been throwing together a simple contacts app.  Yes, it’s been done before, but I needed a way to manage some contacts so I figured I’d learn a little and make one myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one year left of college, I’ve started reaching out to various connections and people whose work I admire and find interesting.  I guess adults call this networking.  I keep the list of people to contact in a note on my phone, but as the list gets longer, it’s more difficult to keep track of where everybody lives, what their emails are, etc.  I wanted a way to make sure that when I get back to the US, I know who I need to contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so here’s the contacts manager I made.  I might add a couple features in my free time/fix the issues with it, but for now, it’s simple and it works.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mobile Money Potential</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Centralized payment processing companies like Visa or MasterCard exist so that we can open accounts with whatever bank we want, but still pay on the same machines.  If they didn’t, each bank would need its own payment processing system and you’d only be able to pay at terminals that work with your specific bank.  Think paying with Amex is difficult now?  The whole thing would be a gigantic mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mobile money platforms however, that second scenario is the reality.  Most mobile money platforms are built around telecom operators, and suffer from two main issues: interoperability and complete financial services.  For consumers, this means having several phones, sim cards, and mobile wallets to have the flexibility that makes mobile payment practical.  For merchants, this means having multiple terminals to be able to accept payments from different mobile money providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the West, Visa and Mastercard solve these problems and have built a massive structure to ensure that they work well.  To use this system that works well, the merchant typically pays around 2-3% in fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s fascinating in developing countries, is that they skipped the entire dark ages of paying with cards and have gone straight to paying with phones.  However, there is no centralized structure for these payments and the entire thing is built on phone numbers, not card numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about changing innovation in the banking sector, solutions like Apple are really just a fancier way to pay with a card.  The structure doesn’t change.  And in developed countries, it probably won’t for a very very very long time.  Everybody has a card, the networks are massive, and there’s no real need to change.  (Although…  Stay tuned because Bitcoin could kick ass)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing countries, this whole situation is extremely exciting because nobody knows how the system will develop.  There’s an unprecedented opportunity for a new banking structure that’s faster, more secure, and more advanced than what we have now.  As mobile money continues to expand in developing countries, it will be fascinating to see how these solutions deal with problems like interoperability, exchanges between countries, performance, security, and all the other problems that face traditional banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRzTaWZ6ebs&quot;&gt;quick video&lt;/a&gt; of how card processors like Visa work. If you have 10 minutes, it’s kind of interesting.  TL;DR (TL;DW?) here’s more or less what happens when you swipe your card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The terminal gathers some information on your card, the transaction, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That information, along with the merchant’s ID and whatnot is sent to an acquirer (the merchant’s bank)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The acquirer sends the info along to the processor (Visa/Mastercard/etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The processor sends the info to your bank&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your bank checks if you have the money to spend and authorizes the transaction (hopefully)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your bank tells the processor that the transaction is approved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The processor tells the acquirer that the transaction is approved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And finally your card is approved and you get your stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh but wait.  The money still has to get from your bank to the acquiring bank and to the merchant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your bank keeps a cut of the money you just spent and sends the rest to the processor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The processor keeps a cut and sends the money to the acquirer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The acquirer keeps a cut and sends the rest to the merchant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Konza Tech City, Kenya</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my job is researching things having to do with mobile money in Africa.  I’ll explain mobile money and why it’s important in another post, but future TL;DR, it’s important, you should care about it, and its potential is particularly huge in many African and Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the other day I stumbled upon some articles about Konza Tech City in Kenya.  Granted, the project started a few years ago, but I had never heard of it, I thought it was pretty cool, and I’m sharing it with you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nairobi is one of the leading tech cities in Africa and is full of incubators, geeky people, and cool startups.  The Kenyan government decided to build the Konza Technology City nearby to capitalize on business outsourcing and IT things (more or less taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.konzacity.go.ke&quot;&gt;Konza City&lt;/a&gt; website).  Basically they’re building a brand new city from the ground up that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and become the “Silicon Savannah” of Africa.  Oh and it’s also going to be sustainable,  livable, etc etc.  Mostly all good stuff (some criticism &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big picture, Konza City speaks to the immense amount of innovation happening in Africa.  The most transformative new technology is born out of necessity.  A new way to turn on a lightbulb isn’t quite what you’d call necessity.  Providing financial services to billions of people using “dumb” phones they already own, is.  And it’s innovations like this that are happening in Africa today.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en&quot;&gt;This Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt; sums it up pretty well.  Real innovation is happening in Africa because Africa is solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

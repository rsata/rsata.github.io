		<h1><a href="/blog/posts/french-countryside/">A Long Weekend in the Middle of Nowhere</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Last weekend it was Bastille day in France. More or less the equivalent to 4th of July for us, but with more wine and less beer. Bastille Day represents the symbolic beginning of the French Revolution, when an angry mob raided the fortress in 1789 for gunpowder, weapons, and ammunition. In the next 15 years, France got a number of things, including but not limited to their national anthem - “la Marseillaise” - the guillotine, a constitution, and the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>Anyways, for this marvelous holiday I did what most Parisians do in the summer, and got the hell out of Paris. My friend’s family has a country house about an hour and a half away, so we spent a long weekend there lounging next to the pool.</p>

<p>In France, the minimum number of paid vacations your work can give you is at a quite comfortable five. In addition, if you work more than 35 hours a week (say, I don’t know, a 40 hour week?), you get an optional extra two weeks. Of course, there are workaholics in every country who would rather be at work than at the beach. However, of those two weeks, five (I think…) are not optional.</p>

<p>By the end of those four days, I needed to get back and work on projects or SOMETHING. But my friends didn’t. And I think that’s a very important difference between a lot of the people I’ve met here, and many stressed out workaholics in the US. Here, people separate work and life. I’ve heard many say that in the US, people live to work, while in France, they work to live. And it’s totally 100% accurate. While we do give the French a lot of shit for their wimpy 35 hour work week, month long vacations, high taxes, and unfavorable business climate, I think there’s something to be said about a high quality of life and general happiness (even though those things mentioned above are still issues). Here, people get what really matters, and what makes them happy. There’s no impossible quest to satisfy a bottomless bucket of ambition, nor any question about where work ends and where life begins. Those people all moved to the US.</p>

<p>With school work and other projects and things (like finding a job…… ugh.), it’s easy to fall into the trap of never being able to take a breath. There’s always something to do, and it’s always urgent. But being here has made me realize it’s really not urgent. So stop, smell the roses, and enjoy your fucking life.</p>

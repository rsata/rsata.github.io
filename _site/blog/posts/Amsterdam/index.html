	<div class="post-content"><p>One of the best parts of living in Europe is how friggen close you are to some of the coolest cities in the world.  Last weekend I went to Amsterdam to visit a friend and spend a few days riding bicycles, listening to music, and drinking coffee.  Casual.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice when you get out of the train station is the ridiculous amount of bikes.  It’s the most convenient way to get around town, and everybody does it.  I rented a bike for a few days, and apart from almost crashing a couple times, it was fantastic.  Amsterdam is one of the prettiest cities I’ve ever been to and riding down cobblestone streets next to the canals and accross bridges feels like you’re in a movie.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about all these European cities is the amount of ridiculously famous art in all the museums.  Opting to avoid the 2 hour wait to get into Ann Frank’s house, I visited the Rijksmuseum.  I enjoy going to museums every now and then, and it’s always kind of cool to see things you recognize from old textbooks.  The Rijksmuseum is home to some well known stuff from Vermeer and Rembrandt, and just the building alone is impressive.</p>

<p>Elephant in the room.  Coffeeshops.  Yes, I went to one.  Duh.  But honestly, it wasn’t all that exciting or anything.  Weed in Amsterdam is more for the older generation and tourists.  A few years ago they experimented with not allowing foreigners to buy weed at all.  In some cities I’m pretty sure coffeeshops can only sell to residents.  However, after they realized the catastrophic effect it would have on tourism, you can pretty much buy weed anywhere in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Anyways, my weekend in Amsterdam was awesome and I want to go back.</p>

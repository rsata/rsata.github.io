<p>My time abroad came to an abrupt halt a couple weeks ago. But not before I snuck one last excellent long weekend trip in, this time to Rome. It’s not very often that Italy wins at things, but in this case, the capitol kicks the world’s ass at the highest...</p>

<p>Last weekend it was Bastille day in France. More or less the equivalent to 4th of July for us, but with more wine and less beer. Bastille Day represents the symbolic beginning of the French Revolution, when an angry mob raided the fortress in 1789 for gunpowder, weapons, and ammunition....</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had the chance to eat at a little restaurant in Paris call Le Sot L’y Laisse. We later learned on the way home that Le Sot L’y Laisse is a small piece of dark meat located on the back, and considered the best part of...</p>

<p>Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS. Over the past year, one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, a few libraries and frameworks, and now I can build basic web apps. I’ve never taken a formal programming class, so I’m sure my...</p>

<p>Centralized payment processing companies like Visa or MasterCard exist so that we can open accounts with whatever bank we want, but still pay on the same machines. If they didn’t, each bank would need its own payment processing system and you’d only be able to pay at terminals that work...</p>

<p>Part of my job is researching things having to do with mobile money in Africa. I’ll explain mobile money and why it’s important in another post, but future TL;DR, it’s important, you should care about it, and its potential is particularly huge in many African and Asian countries. Anyways, the...</p>

<p>One of the best parts of living in Europe is how friggen close you are to some of the coolest cities in the world. Last weekend I went to Amsterdam to visit a friend and spend a few days riding bicycles, listening to music, and drinking coffee. Casual. The first...</p>

<p>I started my job here about 3 weeks ago now at a small fintech company called Tagattitude. It’s great, and what the company does is very interesting. There are over 2 billion people in the world without access to financial services. This means they can’t save for the future, take...</p>

<p>My semester in Dakar ended about two weeks ago, and now I’m in Paris until the end of July. Being back has given me some time to think about my time in Senegal and the most important things I’ll take away from my three and a half months there. There...</p>

    <p class="blog-date">13 Jun 2015</p>
  
<p>Centralized payment processing companies like Visa or MasterCard exist so that we can open accounts with whatever bank we want, but still pay on the same machines. If they didn’t, each bank would need its own payment processing system and you’d only be able to pay at terminals that work...</p>


  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2015-06-07-contacts-meteor-fun/">Playing Around in Meteor.js</a></h2>
    <p class="blog-date">01 Jun 2015</p>
  
<p>Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS. Over the past year one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, and now I can build some basic web apps. From HTML and CSS to different libraries and frameworks. I’ve never taken a formal programming...</p>

    <p class="blog-date">23 May 2015</p>
  
<p>Part of my job is researching things having to do with mobile money in Africa. I’ll explain mobile money and why it’s important in another post, but future TL;DR, it’s important, you should care about it, and its potential is particularly huge in many African and Asian countries.

    <p class="blog-date">12 May 2015</p>
  
<p>I started my job here about 3 weeks ago now at a small fintech company called Tagattitude. It’s great, and what the company does is very interesting. There are over 2 billion people in the world without access to financial services. This means they can’t save for the future, take...</p>


  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2-weeks-in-the-western-world/">2 Weeks Back in the Western World</a></h2>
    <p class="blog-date">01 May 2015</p>
  
<p>My semester in Dakar ended about two weeks ago, and now I’m in Paris until the end of July. Being back has given me some time to think about my time in Senegal and the most important things I’ll take away from my three and a half months there. There...</p>

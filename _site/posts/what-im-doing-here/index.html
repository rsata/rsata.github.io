	<div class="post-content"><p>I started my job here about 3 weeks ago now at a small fintech company called Tagattitude.  It’s great, and what the company does is very interesting.</p>

<p>There are over 2 billion people in the world without access to financial services.  This means they can’t save for the future, take out a loan, send money, … - all the services many of us take for granted.  Of these 2 billion, over a billion have phones.  In some of the poorest parts of the world, mobile penetration has surpassed 90% of the population, giving these populations the only tools they need to access financial services that are just as advanced as those found in the western world.</p>

<p>That’s where mobile money comes in.  It is extremely expensive for banks to build new branches in remote areas, especially given limited infrastructure and resources.  However, by turning mobile phones into payment devices, where your phone number becomes your account number, banks are starting to reach areas left underserved by the traditional banking system.</p>

<p>The company I work for provides the platform for mobile financial service (MFS) providers.  If you just can’t help yourself and want to learn more about what this entails, checkout the website: <a href="http://tagpay.fr">tagpay.fr</a>.</p>

<p>And this all matters because financial inclusion is paramount to the development of these areas.  Helping mobile money providers reach more people for fractions of the cost is a step towards bringing these parts of the world out of poverty.  With more money in banks, resource mobilization helps develops the area.  With quick and easy transfers, more people have access to loans, and microcredit.  They can develop a credit history, and have a safe place to save money for the future.  Mobile money also reduces the volume of cash in the system, helping workers get paid on time, improving security, and saving the billions spent today dealing with the logistics of transporting, distributing and securing cash.</p>

<p>From the little experience I have, I’ve learned that for me, one of the most important things when choosing a company is to find one that is doing something worth caring about.  That is definitely the case here at Tagattitude and I’m glad to be a part of it.</p>

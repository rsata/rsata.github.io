	<div class="post-content"><p>Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS.  Over the past year one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, and now I can build some basic web apps.</p>

<p>From HTML and CSS to different libraries and frameworks.</p>

<p>I’ve never taken a formal programming class, so my technique and regard for any sort of standard is definitely a little off.</p>

<p>In my experience over the past year, the most difficult part has been dealing with the backend.  Something just doesn’t quite click for me and I much prefer spending time on the front end thinking about look, feel, and UX.  So you can probably imaging, when I found Meteor a couple months ago I was stoked.  No more hours digging through Stack Exchange and blog tutorials figuring out which DB to use, how to create secure login, connect oauth, bla bla bla</p>

<p>Being abroad for long, and one year left of college, I’ve started reaching out to various connections and people whose work I admire and find interesting.  I guess you adults call this networking.</p>

<p>I kept the list of people to contact in a note on my iPhone, but as the list gets longer, it’s more difficult to keep track of where everybody lives, what their emails are, etc.  I wanted a way to make sure that when I visit a place and have some free time, I know who in my network lives there that I can connect with for coffee or food.</p>

<p>Yes, there are lots of things that already do this.  But whatever.  This was more of a learning thing for me, and a way to play around in Meteor.</p>

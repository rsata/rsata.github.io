	<div class="post-content"><p>My semester in Dakar ended about two weeks ago, and now I’m in Paris until the end of July.  Being back has given me some time to think about my time in Senegal and the most important things I’ll take away from my three and a half months there.</p>

<p>There are two very important aspects about Senegal I’ll miss, and I think we can all learn from here in the western world.</p>

<p>The first is the strength of the community. From interactions with taxi drivers, to merchants, to waiters, to students, there’s a sense that everybody will take care of each other.  Senegal is one of the least touched countries by famines in the area because of people’s willingness to help other in times of need.  Families are large and everybody helps if a member needs help.  And families aren’t just blood related.  Close family friends and members of the community are also considered a part of the family.  So much so that I had friends who had aunts and uncles with whom they weren’t sure how they were related.</p>

<p>Walking down the street, you talk to people and say hi to all the familiar faces you cross.  When someone tried to rob a student on our trip, the entire neighborhood was asking her if she was ok for weeks.  Even the people she had never talked to.  People look out for each other and there’s a sort of connection you feel towards others in your community and neighborhood.</p>

<p>The second is how well the Senegalese separate money from happiness.  In a country where the majority lives with about $2 a day, I met so many more kind, relaxed, and genuinely happy people than anywhere else in the world.  And it’s not just a happiness you feel when talking to people, its something you feel walking down the street.  It’s a general feeling in the air where people are content with what they have, and happy to be alive.  Things move slowly and once you adjust to the general noise and chaos of the city, the vibe is actually very relaxed.  People don’t worry about money and wealth, and I think as a result, are happier.</p>

<p>I think this second aspect about separating happiness from wealth stems from the first.  People’s happiness doesn’t come from the things they own, or even the things they do.  Instead it comes from those around them - from their community, their friends and their family.  And so after a couple weeks back in a country where people keep to themselves and walk down the streets with two headphones in staring at their feet, these are the two things I’ll miss most about Senegal.</p>

<p>I decided not to import my senegal blog over to this one.  If you’re interested, the whole things over at <a href="http://reidsata.blogspot.com/">rsata.blogspot.com</a></p>

I am currently part of Lewis &amp; Clark's Incubator and Launch Seed Fund. I am working on a project called PlanIt, helping people explore their surroundings, and organize their days. My team was one of six teams accepted into the incubator, and we received a secondary round of funds to further advance our idea.

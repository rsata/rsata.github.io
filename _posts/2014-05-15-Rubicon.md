Rubicon is an education consulting company based in Portland, OR. They write curriculum mapping software to help teachers and administrators collaborate, share curriculum, and keep track of everchanging standards.

## Things I did

Researched and developed content marketing strategy to help increase traffic to the professional development site. The strategy helped double page views, and is being used to help chnage the image of the company.

Prepared and gave a marketing demo to senior members of the company, simulating an on-site demonstration of the company software.

Worked on the deployment team to help prepare and maintain client sites. This included growing and maintaining a database of over 1,200 sets of national, state, and international education standards.

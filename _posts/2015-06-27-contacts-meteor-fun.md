Last summer, I taught myself a little HTML and CSS.  Over the past year, one hour of procrastination lead to another, I learned a little JS, a few libraries and frameworks, and now I can build basic web apps.  I've never taken a formal programming class, so I'm sure my code is full of things that would make any experienced developer cringe.  But it works, and so they tell me, that's all that matters.

Over the past year, the most difficult part for me has been learning backend development.  Something just doesn't quite click for me and I much prefer spending time on the frontend thinking about look, feel, and UX.  So I was pretty stoked when I found Meteor a couple months ago.  No more hours digging through StackOverflow and blog tutorials figuring out how to set up a database, create secure logins, connect oauth, bla bla bla

So anyways, the past couple weekends I've been throwing together a simple contacts app.  Yes, it's been done before, but I needed a way to manage some contacts so I figured I'd learn a little and make one myself.

With one year left of college, I've started reaching out to various connections and people whose work I admire and find interesting.  I guess adults call this networking.  I keep the list of people to contact in a note on my phone, but as the list gets longer, it's more difficult to keep track of where everybody lives, what their emails are, etc.  I wanted a way to make sure that when I get back to the US, I know who I need to contact.

And so here's the contacts manager I made.  I might add a couple features in my free time/fix the issues with it, but for now, it's simple and it works.
